Write an efficient function that checks whether any permutation of an input string is a palindrome.

You can assume the input string only contains lowercase letters. Examples:

"civic" should return True

"ivicc" should return True

"civil" should return False

"livci" should return False

"But 'ivicc' isn't a palindrome!"

If you had this thought, read the question again carefully. We're asking if any permutation of the string is a palindrome. Spend some extra time ensuring you fully understand the question before starting.

We can do this in O(n) time.
